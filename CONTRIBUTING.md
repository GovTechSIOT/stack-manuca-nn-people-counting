# Contributing to MANUCA OS

MANUCA OS is an open-source real-time operating system designed to be use with the MANUCA DK. Contributions are an important part of the MANUCA ecosystem, and our goal is to make it as simple as possible to become a contributor.

To encourage productive collaboration, as well as robust, consistent and maintainable code, we have a set of guidelines for [contributing to MANUCA OS](https://siot.gov.sg/tech-stack/manuca/manuca-os-contribution/).
